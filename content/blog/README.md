# Blog

GitBook has a lot to offer:

* Git sync both ways
* a nice Markdown editor with extra bells and whistles via MDX
* or you can author in VS Code
* easy publishing with analytics

Quarto does too:

* supports publishing directly from IPYNB notebooks
* themes, CSS, cell directives
* good but not great publishing options
* can even do iframes

The idea is to use Gitbook together with Quarto.   However, allowed Gitbook content is limited to text and images and a couple [simple embeds](iframes.md).  Maybe it's just an entry point, a CMS for a self-hosted thing (plain S3).
